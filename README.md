# Intermediate AngularJS with LastFM and Parse
You can use the code of the Lastfm project, we will be adding more features here.
We will use the Last.FM api for this project. Go to http://www.last.fm/api to learn
how to use it.

We will use [Parse API](https://parse.com/docs/js_guide) to enable users to sign up and log in to their sites.
The applications ID and Key that you must use are located in [parse.txt](parse.txt).


## Prepare project
To get up and running, you must:
1. Fork the project
2. clone it locally
3. install npm modules
```{shell}
sudo npm install
```
4. install bower components
```{shell}
sudo bower install
```

These commands will install all the necessary libraries and frameworks including: AngularJS, Jasmine and
Parse in a folder called **bower_components**.
